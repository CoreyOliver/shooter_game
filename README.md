# My Shooting Game Project:
Vanilla JS modules leveraging HTML5 canvas elements to create a quick action packed game 'shooting' enemies as they fly by
# How it's made:
Vanilla JS
CSS
HTML5
JS modules are set up following OOP principles
# What I learned:
Worked with different forms of collision detection in games to further practice classes and objects in JS. 
Fine tuned abstraction skills and refactoring skills
## Optimizations
New enemy(s) and pattern(s)
Scoring and lives
tighter collision window outside of 'box' or 'circle/radius' collision detection
